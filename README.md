This is a supplementary folder of the files that come with a manuscript "Social Media Use Does Not Alter Cross-Population Consensus in First Impression Judgments" (working tittle). 
----
You find here the following files here: 
R Scripts: 
1_Data_curage.R It shows how data were processed and how the final table, provided to the reader, was created.  
2_Models.R Main models, as reported in the manuscript.
3_Plotting_Main_Model.R Trascription of how the posteriors were processed and how figures in the manuscript were done. Mind that some might have been edited in InkScape. 
4_Plotting_Separate_Models.R Do you remember we also did models with only one of the three rating scales' ratings predicted? We did, and this is to the script where we create figures based on these models. 
5_PlottingModels_with_Centre_Scores_Excluded.R We also excluded participants who were in the 25% band around Median for at least two of the three scales based on which the split was done. In this script, we show how the figures were created for these models. 
6_Models_Travel_Childhood_SES.R We also splitted participants based on their frequency of traveling abroad and their socioeconomic status during childhood. The models are sampled through this script. 
7_Plotting_Travel_Abroad_Models.R Here we create figures based on models from script 6.
8_Plotting_Childhood_SES.R Here we also create figures based on models from script 6.

Datasets: 
"Whole_Dataset_long_GMM_INCLUDED_SIDESCENTRE_INCLUDED_17_01_25.csv" Old version of the data. Contains former "Czech control sample", which was later excluded. Provided for interested reader who'd like to chech the data we use for "YUFE_Rating_study_Old_Analyses.pdf". 
"Whole_Dataset_long_GMM_INCLUDED_SIDESCENTRE_INCLUDED_SOCBACK_TRAVELABROAD_INCL_05_05_25.csv" new dataset that do not contain "Czech control sample" in which we are not interested anymore, however, contains information on how frequently given rater travelled abroad and how was he doing as a child. 

Other things: 
"Attractiveness_Trustworthiness_Men_Women_Separately" R project. Run this if you want to check the scripts. You should then experience little or no problems with formatting, etc. 
"Supplements_07_05_25.docx" Supplementary materials. It's 38 pages, but it's mostly Figure 1, 2, 3, and 4, when different datasets are considered. 
"YUFE_Rating_Study_Old_Analyses.pdf". Originally (as we predicted) we wanted to include Czech control sample, which was tempting, since the dataset was large (N=777) raters. Nevertheless, the raters only rated Attactiveness and Trustworthiness. 
To include Dominance, we had to go for another "Czech control sample", in which participants rated on Likert scale 1-7. Moreover, in neither of the two "Czech control sets" were the participants asked on how / if they use social media. 
Therefore, we decided to exclude the Czech control samples. However, to avoid accusition we are hiding something else than our bad design decision, we provide the full results (also to somehow justify the weeks that would otherwise be lost).
